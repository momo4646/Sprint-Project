# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

# User needs can be interpreted into tasks to complete in order to satisfy the request of the users. Each task can then be turned into an alogrithm that can be translated for computers to understand. Creating user stories helps with this by adding value and reality to the tasks that the developer must complete. With context in mind, they can better tailor their work to what is wanted.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

# I approach developing programs as a creative process. Development should begin with a basic framework and then evolve with new increments. Agile processes I hope to incorporate would be creating incremental, functional pieces of a program and testing it as I create it.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

# Being a good team member means holding up to one's responsibilities. This means completing tasks, communicating with other team members, and being present during meetings. This also means bringing a positive outlook to help support a good work environment.
